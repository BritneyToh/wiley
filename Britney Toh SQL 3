SQL
Syntax:
  1. SELECT: Retrieve Values from one or more tables in database
     SELECT field1, field1, field3
     FROM table1
     WHERE criteria
     ORDER BY field1, field2;
     
  2. ; : Ends a command line
  
  3. Line breaks and indents: Each field on a seperate line, each clause on a seperate line
     CREATE TABLE `TestTable` (
     TestID CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
     Column1 VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
     Column2 VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
     Column3 DATE NULL
     );
     
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, Address 
    FROM Client;
    
  4. SQL is not case-sensitive: Select=SELECT=select
  
  5. Commas: Used to seperate LIKE objects in a series, like fields. DO NOT USE COMMA TO SEPERATE FIELDS AND COMMANDS (unlike objects)
  
  6. Quotation marks: Use either '' or "". Identify fields whose names include spaces or special characters, as well as string values in conditional statements or when 
  adding data to a table
