##Run a command to see all the processes running on the server owned by everyone.
ps -ef

##Confirm the username you are running as.
echo $USER

##Run a command to see all the processes running on the server and use grep to select only the processes your user is running.
ps -ef | grep "$USER"

##Repeat the previous exercise. This time, select every process except things running as you.
ps -ef | grep -v "$USER"

##Show the process info for our current session without using a grep command.
ps -f$$

##Show the process tree for the current session.
pstree -shapu $$

##Run a process check on the server but only output the User, pid and cmd columns to your results.
ps -eo uid,pid,comm

##Run a process check to pull all of the process ids running on the server and put the output into a file named list in your home directory.
touch processes.list
ps -eo pid > ~/processes.list

##Run the following series of commands:

##sleep 300 &
##Find this command by checking the processes and running a grep
ps -ef | grep "$USER | grep "sleep"

##Stop the process using the process id
kill 28520

##Run a command to see a dynamic view of all the processes running on your host.
top

##Now run the same command but specifically only for root.
top -u root

##Experiment with the following commands while running top and note your observations:

z: highlight running process in top
c: give me the absolute path of each of the processes running
Shift P: sort the results by CPU utilization
k: allow me to process a kill id

##Run a command to check network connectivity between your Linux session and yahoo.com.
ping yahoo.com

##show the network route between your session and yahoo.com and output the contents into a file named yahoo.route in your home directory.
traceroute yahoo.com

##View the file using less and see how many hops it took to get there.
less yahoo.route

##Create a soft link named route to your network route.
ln -s route yahoo.route

##Run a command to see all the network sockets on your server and output to a file named output in your home directory.
netstat > output

##Create a folder named network in your home directory.
mkdir network

##Move your route file and network output file into the network folder you just created.
mv route network
mv output network

##Run the command to query your network interfaces on your session.
ifconfig

##Run the following command to put your results in the directory the trainer specified.
