## Python Syntax
## Activity 1
# display the text in quotation marks to an output block
print("Python is fun!")

# Display the text in quotation marks to an output block 
# without moving any of the existing acode to a different line
print("Python is fun!") 
print("Python is also easy.")

# Display the text in quotation marks to an output block 
# without moving any of the existing code to a different line
print("Python is fun!")

# Change each variable name to an appropriate name for Python. 
# Do not use the same variable name more than one time.
first-name = "Rebecca" # first name
last_name = "Roberts" # last name
 
# After changing the variable names, update the code below 
# to print out each name.
print(first-name)
print(last_name)

## Activity 2
# Add a new line of code that displays the text in quotation marks 
# to an output block without repeating the text in quotation marks.
output = "I love Python!"
 
# your code below this line
print("I love Python!")

# Display only the text Python is fun! to an output block 
# without deleting any of the existing code
def text1():
    print("Python is fun!")
def text2():
    print("Python is also easy!")
  
text1()

## Create a script that prompts the user for the name of the state where they were born and the name of the state where they live now.
def stateborn(x):
    return f"You were born in {x} state"

x=input("Which state were you born in? ")

def statenow(y):
    return f"You live in state {y} now"

y=input("Which state do you live in now? ")

print(stateborn(x))
print(statenow(y))

## Self-Assessment
def user():
    firstname=input("What is your first name? ")
    lastname=input("What is your last name? ")
    phone=input("What is your phone number? ")
    yearborn=input("What is the year you are born in? ")
    return f"First Name: {firstname}, Last Name: {lastname}, Phone number: {phone}, DOB: {yearborn}"
