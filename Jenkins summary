## Jenkins
## Creating a new job


## Pipeline
  - Automate testing and reporting on isolated changes in a larger code base in real time
    - Run an initial suite of unit tests to ensure that the commit did not “break the build”
    - If the tests do not pass, the developer can be immediately notified to take corrective action (determine which commit caused build to fail)
  - Facilitates the integration of disparate branches of the code into a main branch

## Create a pipeline (Python)
Jenkinsfile (save as Jenkinsfile)
pipeline {
    agent { docker { image 'python:3.10.1-alpine' } }
    stages {
        stage('build') {
            steps {
                sh 'python --version'
            }
        }
    }
}

New item > Multibranch pipeline > Add source > Save

## sh: used to execute shell command in a pipeline
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Hello World"'
                sh '''
                    echo "Multiline shell steps works too"
                    ls -lah
                '''
            }
        }
    }
}
