database: Structured representation of data that we can read from and wrire to
##stores data as tables, rows and columns

database management system (dbms): software system that manages databases

keys: unique identifier for each record in each row
##primary key: cannot be replicated in same table
##foreign key: primary key becomes a foreign key in secondary table

one-to-one relationships: each row in one table corresponds to only one row in another table, vice-versa

one-to-many relationships: each primary key corresponds to multiple records in the second table, but each record in the second table corresponds to only one record in the first table

many-to-many relationships: each primary key corresponds to multiple foreign keys, vice-versa
##bridge table: supports all the unique combinations of primary and foreign keys

ACID: guidelines for databases to adhere to to withstand unexpected failures without data corruption
##Atomicity: All or nothing. If one action in the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails
##Consistenct: A transaction is only consistent if it can move the database from one valid state to another valid state
##Isolation: Isolation means a transaction cannot affect another transaction until it is complete. 
##Durability:  Durablity means a transaction will remain in the database once it is committed. If the server is out, it is still there.
  It is not fully committed until it is written to permanent storage.
  
  Databases and log files: Contains history of executed actions. Log file is physically seperate from actual database data.
